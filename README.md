# FluidUI Editable DetailsList

## Overview
FluentUI is a great UI library with some really cool controls, all adhering to Accessibility Standards.

DetailsList control of FluidUI is great when your requirement is a read-only grid. However, it does not offer any in-place editability functionality just yet.

This component(Editable DetailsList) is a wrapper over the existing DetailsList that makes in-place editability work like a dream(among many other new features).

Some of the features of the Editable Grid are:-
>- Single Cell Edit (in-place)
>- Single Row Edit (in-place)
>- Single Column Edit
>- Multi-Column, multi-row edit (Bulk Edit)
>- Full Edit (Edit Mode)
>- Deleting Rows
>- Adding Rows
>- Default Data Export (to Excel, CSV)
>- Implement Custom Export functionality
>- Callback hook to recieve grid data in the consuming component(for Save etc.)
>- Support for various controls in grid in-place edit like TextField, Multiline TextField, DatePicker (Support for Dropdown will be released soon)
>- Flexibility to implement onChange callback on any cell value change (For cases like calculating summation of a column etc)
>- Length Validations during edit
>- Type Validations during edit
>- The component is completely Accessible
